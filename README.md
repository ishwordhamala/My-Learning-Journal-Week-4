# My-Learning-Journal-Week 5 
I discovered this week how to use a JSON file to link my PWA to a Python backend. I saved reflections into reflections using Python rather than just keeping data in the browser like localStorage.json, which functions more like a little database. The file is read by my Python script, which then automatically updates it with fresh reflections. Additionally, I updated my diary page with a new feature that loads the JSON file, displays all saved reflections, and enables weekly filtering. Whereas GitHub only displays the version I submit since it is unable to execute Python, locally I can view the most current data I store using Python. All in all, this week improved my comprehension of the relationship between front-end and back-end data.
