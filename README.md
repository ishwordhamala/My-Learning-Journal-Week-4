# My-Learning-Journal-Week
This week I learned how to use different types of JavaScript APIs to make my website more dynamic.
I used the Storage API to save new journal entries into the browser using localStorage, so that even after refreshing the page, my notes stay visible.
I also used the Browser Validation API to check if the form is filled correctly before saving an entry. It shows an error message if a field is empty or too short.
Finally, I connected a Third-Party API to my homepage which fetches a motivational quote each time I click the “Load Quote” button.
These features made my learning journal feel more interactive and realistic.
